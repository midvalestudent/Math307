function spectrogram(y,Fs,TW,M)

% y is the sampled signal
% Fs is the sampling frequency
% TW is the window size in seconds
% M is the number of windows

% Calculate
% N: the length of y
% T: the time length of the signal
% NW: the number of samples per window
% NWmax: the number of frequencies to be plotted (1/4 of NW)
% Omega: the vector of frequencies


% Calculate 
% Times: a vector containing the times for the centre of each window
% C: a matrix containing the amplitudes for each window in its columns
% First initialize them to be zero

Times=zeros(1,M);
C=zeros(NWmax,M);

% Then use a for loop to fill in the values

for i=1:M
	jmin = %put the lower index for the ith window here
	jmax = %put the upper index for the ith window here
	Times(i) = %put the time corresponding to the centre of the ith window here
	tildec = %compute the fft of the part of the signal between jmin and jmax
	C(:,i) = %set the ith column to be the first NWmax absolute values of tildec
end

% the following commands make the plot

pcolor(Times, Omega, C);
shading interp;
colormap(1-gray);
